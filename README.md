Enables to launch Python programs with command lines and reusable launcher scheme classes.
This module allows you to forget many of the platform-specific details. 
Automatically inserts "Python" and/or path to Python executable at front of command line.
Some of this module may assume 'python' is on your system path.
Runs program file names through 'normpath()' to change Windows special characters.
You can just import this module and use 'PortableLauncher' to call it as method.
IMPORTANT: this module is only skeleton to build your own cross-platform launch solution.
